# Online Coding Quiz

## Description

I created a Online Quiz using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON. Utilizing the Local Storage Feature, I was able to create a High Scores page to allow the user to enter his/her initials and save it next to their final score! This project was a huge learning curve and was pretty difficult for me, as the first true JavaScript based project I am proud that I was able to work through it and get it done! Hope you enjoy it!
